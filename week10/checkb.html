        <h2>10 Prepare : Checkpoint B - Sorting</h2>


        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="./prepare.html">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This checkpoint is intended to help you practice the syntax of a basic sorting algorithm.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>For this assignment, you need to implement either a selection sort or an insertion sort, which ever did not choose for checkpoint a, and use it to sort an array of integers.</p>


        <h3>Testbed</h3>
        <p>
            An auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.
        </p>

        <p>Please note that it is possible to do this assignment without using one of these sorts, but this will not help you understand the concept, and you will not receive credit if you do not follow the instructions.
        </p>

You can run this script as many times as you like while you are working on the assignment. The same test script will be run by the instructor for credit, so you should not be surprised at the result.</p>

        <p>In addition, because the point of this exercise is to help you practice the use of classes. <strong>You must use classes</strong> to receive credit for this assignment.</p>

        <p>To run the test script, log into the CS Department Linux system and run the <code>testBed</code> command, providing the class and test script to run as well as the Python program to use, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
testBed cs241/check04b check04b.py
</code></pre>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Submit your program by logging into the CS Department Linux system, and running the submit command with your filename, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
submit check04b.py
</code></pre>

        <p>You should then select the appropriate course (CS 241), instructor, and assignment from the list.</p>

        <h2>02 Prove : Assignment</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This assignment will give you practice using Python to read from files and process information.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Write a Python 3 program to read from a .csv file containing rates from power companies. Your program should determine the average commercial rate, and also display the information for the highest and lowest rates found.</p>

        <p>The data file you will use is freely available from <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-electric-utility-companies-and-rates-look-up-by-zipcode-feb-2011-57a7c">data.gov</a>. It lists the commercial (comm_rate), industrial (ind_rate), and residential (res_rate) rates  for each zip code.</p>

        <p>Your program should do the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Prompt the user for a filename.</p></li>
            <li><p>Open the requested file and read through it line by line.</p></li>
            <li><p>Ignore the first line, as it contains header information.</p></li>
            <li><p>Find the column for comm_rate and keep track of it as needed. (You may assume the file will have a consistent ordering of columns.)</p></li>
            <li><p>After parsing through the complete file, display the average (mean) commercial rate across all zip codes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Display the utility company, zip code, state, and rate for the zip code with the highest commercial rate in the file.</p></li>
            <li><p>Display the utility company, zip code, state, and rate for the zip code with the lowest commercial rate in the file.</p></li>
            <li><p>If there is a tie for the highest or lowest rate, you should display the zip code that came first in the file.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>To help you in your development efforts, two versions of the data set will be provided:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>/home/cs241/assign02/rates-small.csv</p></li>
            <li><p>/home/cs241/assign02/rates.csv</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sample Output</h3>
        <p>The following is an example of the output that should be generated:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
Please enter the data file: <span class="user-input">/home/cs241/assign02/rates.csv</span>

The average commercial rate is: xxxxx

The highest rate is:
utility company, zip code, state, and rate

The lowest rate is:
utility company, zip code, state, and rate
</code></pre>

        <h3>Automatic Grading Script (TestBed)</h3>
        <p>An auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used as part of the grading of your program. However, unlike the Checkpoint programs, <strong>your code will also be evaluated</strong> for style and overall design / implementation.</p>

        <p>The TestBed script can be run as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
testBed cs241/assign02 myAssign02.py
</code></pre>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Submit your program by logging into the CS Department Linux system, and running the submit command with your filename. Example (assuming my file is named "myAssign02.py":</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
submit myAssign02.py
</code></pre>

        <p>You should then select the appropriate course (CS 241), instructor, and assignment from the list.</p>

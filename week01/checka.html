        <h2>01 Prepare : Checkpoint A</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Demonstrate that you can write and submit a simple program in Python.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Write a program in Python 3 that displays the text <code>Hello Python World</code> on the screen.</p>

        <h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre><code>
Hello Python World!
</code></pre>

        <h3>Automatic Grading Script (TestBed)</h3>
        <p>This assignment is pass/fail. In order to receive credit it must pass the auto-grading test script (TestBed). You can run this script as many times as you like while you are working on the assignment. The same test script will be run by the instructor for credit, so you should not be surprised at the result.</p>

        <p>To run the test script, log into the CS Department Linux system and run the <code>testBed</code> command providing the class and test script to run and the program to run it on as follows:</p>

<pre><code>
testBed class/assignment yourFile.py
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, for this checkpoint, if my file were named "check01a.py", I would type the following:</p>

<pre><code>
testBed cs241/check01a check01a.py
</code></pre>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Submit your program by logging into the CS Department Linux system, and running the submit command with your filename. Example (assuming my file is named "check01a.py":</p>

<pre><code>
submit check01a.py
</code></pre>

        <p>You should then select the appropriate course (CS 241), instructor, and assignment (check01a) from the list.</p>
